# Quorum
Running a Constitutional Convention

## Setup

To access Quorum online, go to quorumvote.com

To run Quorum locally:

Quorum was built using MAMP as a testing environment.

1. Download MAMP (for Mac users) https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/

2. Download the Quorum project files and place into the htdocs/ folder of MAMP.

3. After the MAMP app is up and running, click "Start" then click "WebStart." Once the localhost homepage has been opened, use the menu to navigate to "Tools" --> "phpMyAdmin" 

4. Once phpMyAdmin is opened, click on the "Import" tab on the top horizontal menu.

5. Choose the database.sql file that is included in the project files for the import target, and click "Go." The quorum database tables should now have been imported.

6. Now, return to the original localhost MAMP homepage and click on "My Website" (by default, it is at http://localhost:8888). Click on the quorum/ folder, and you should be able to run the project.

## Usage

## How to Use

Documentation for your project in the form of a Markdown file called README.md. This documentation is to be a userâ€™s manual for your project. Though the structure of your documentation is entirely up to you, it should be incredibly clear to the staff how and where, if applicable, to compile, configure, and use your project. Your documentation should be at least several paragraphs in length. It should not be necessary for us to contact you with questions regarding your project after its submission. Hold our hand with this documentation; be sure to answer in your documentation any questions that you think we might have while testing your work.
